"With uproar hideous first the Falls appear,
The stunning tumult thundering on the ear
Above, below, where'er the astonished eye
Turns to behold, new opening wonders lie,
This great o'erwhelming work of awful Time
In all its dread magnificence sublime,
Rises on our view amid a crashing roar
That bids us kneel, and Time's great God
adore."
