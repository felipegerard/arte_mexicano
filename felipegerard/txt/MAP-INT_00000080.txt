Ralph Earl was born in Worcester County, Massachusetts, in 1 7 5 1 . I t is not
known where he received his training, but he w a s probably apprenticed in the usual
way to a house and sign painter. J u s t at the beginning of the Revolutionary W a r he
established himself as a portrait painter in New Haven, Connecticut, but his strong
Tory sympathies forced him to flee to England in 1778. H e remained in England for
about six years, painting portraits in London. He returned to America in 1785 and
painted portraits and landscapes in various parts of New England. He died at Bolton,
Connecticut, in 1801. Richardson says in his book Painting in America, " R a l p h E a r l
may be taken as either the most notable of'untrained professionals' or the most unskilled of the professional painters . . . six years in England made scarcely any
impression upon the archaic severity of his Connecticut style."

Ralph E . W. Earl was born in England, the son of Ralph Earl the portrait
painter from Connecticut. He must have been brought to America as an infant. H e
was trained as a portrait painter by his father. T h e young man went to England in
1809 and stayed there for several years; he also visited France before returning to the
United States in 1815. For a time he traveled in the South as an itinerant portrait
painter. Through marrying the niece of Mrs. Andrew Jackson in 1 8 1 8 , Earl became
a sort of "painter in residence" to the Jackson family, both in the White House while
Jackson was President and at Jackson's home, " T h e Hermitage," near Nashville,
Tennessee. In these years Earl painted almost nothing but repetitious portraits of
Andrew Jackson. He died at " T h e Hermitage."
