Thomas Chambers was born in England about 1808 and came to the United
States in 1832. He was a painter of marine views, landscapes, and portraits. He lived
and worked for long periods in New Y o r k City, Albany, and Boston. Some of his
paintings were "inspired" by engraved views of American scenery; his distinctive
manner of painting, however, always gives his pictures a highly individual character.
There are no records of his later career, and the place and date of his death are not
recorded.

Winthrop Chandler was born in "Chandler Hill" in Woodstock, Connecticut, in 1747. Most of his life was spent in Woodstock but he did live for several years
in Worcester, Massachusetts. I t is presumed that he was trained as a house and sign
painter by being apprenticed to a house painter in Boston. Most of Chandler's paintings are portraits of his relatives and friends in Woodstock and Worcester, for he
never traveled about the country as an itinerant artist. He was never able to earn
much money and he died in Woodstock in poverty.

Hyacinthe De Laclotte was born probably in France. He was active in
New Orleans as architect, engraver, scene painter, and drawing teacher from about
1 8 1 1 to 1815. In 1818 a man named Hethe Laclotte was listed in the Philadelphia
Directory as "engraver and architect." Perhaps Hyacinthe and Hethe were the same
person. Details of his later career and the date of his death are not recorded.
