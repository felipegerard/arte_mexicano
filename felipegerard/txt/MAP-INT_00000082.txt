The records of Charles Hofmann's life are very scanty. He worked in
Pennsylvania in the 1870's and, judging by the style of his picture, he must have

Joshua Johnston was a Negro portrait painter who flourished in Baltimore,
Maryland, in the years 1796-1824. It is possible that he was instructed by the artist
Charles Peale Polk, for their paintings are in many respects very similar. Johnston's
name appeared for a number of years in the Baltimore City Directories where he is
listed as a limner. He must have been one of the very few Negroes who earned his
living as a portrait painter at that time.
