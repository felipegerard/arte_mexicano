art of the amateur as well as in the work of the trained but unsophisticated craftsman.
In The Painting of the Ancients by Franciscus Junius, published in 1638, we read:
The painter . . . playeth youthfully. . . which signifieth, to doe a thing with such
courage, pleasantnesse, and ease, that the work may be perceived to proceed out of
a lusty and vigorous youthfulnesse; and certainly, the chiefest and most lively force
of Art consisteth herein, that there appears in the work that same prosperously
prompt and fertile Facilitie which useth to accompany our first endeavours; that is
the very life and spirit of art; which if it be extinguished with too much care of trimming, the whole work will be but a dead and lifelesse thing.

. . . pictures surpassing the apprehension and art of Man . . . insinuate nothing els
but that there is something in them which doth not proceed from laborious curiositie
prescribed by the rules of art, and that the free spirit of the artificer marking how
Nature sporteth herselfe in such an infinite variety of things, undertooke to do the
same.
